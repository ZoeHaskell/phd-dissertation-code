Repository for all the code referenced in my thesis. To be defended in November 2020.

Programs for transforming data between function-space and tree-space: trees to functions is performed by the Harris Path, and functions to trees by Level Set Tree.
Pruning programs remove a set of small leaves from trees, and denoise the corresponding time series. Options are included for paths with long flat portions, i.e. plateaus.
Comparisons in terms of mean-squared error are performed relative to the FFT and to wavelets. 
Edge detection is performed using pruning
